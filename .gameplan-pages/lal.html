				<p>&emsp;Ah, romance. One of grand pleasures of life. Unfortunately, also frequently a great dissapointment. Love of a Lifetime explores romantic events and the awkwardness, comedy, and sadness bundled with them. So as you seek for your one true, make sure you read the asterisk.</p>

If we need to re-edit some of it, I\'ve got the raw footage. That being said, we can probably just throw the new mix over it.', '&emsp;Anti-postcards. These bad boys were created for the original release of MSND back in 2021, and have the highlight lyric \"you\'re not special, I\'m just lonely\". Some edits can be made to the original design to update it, of course. I\'m thinking fonts, the design of the flowers, the gradient... We can print many for pretty cheap, and charge people in order to mail them with their names, or anonymously.', '&emsp;Clips from the music video are our good friends here. MSND is an anti-love story in the sense that it focuses on the dissapointment of love, so we can post clips that make the video and the song look as romantic as possible. Maybe with a dash of tension here and there.', '', '../gameplan-assets/lal/msn-merch.png');const centerpieceElement = document.getElementById("centerpiece");centerpieceElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		msnModal.openModal();});const dbbModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/lal/dbb-modular-bg.jpg', 'Down By Biscayne', 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1723319745%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-ar5amJz0633', 'Cocktail Party', 'Okay, not really a party (although I\'m 100% down to throw one), but we make tutorial videos of cocktail recipes with a comedic twist. The song\'s so chill, it feels like a parody of itself, and the videos can keep that near-parodic vibe as well.', '&emsp;Sunglasses and hammocks. Anything that flows with the easy-going nature of Down By Biscayne. We can try teaming up with a sustainable brands like eco-beach in order to keep it all green. The hammocks can be made down in Ecuador.', '&emsp;It wouldn\'t hurt to license the song to be synced to an incredibly easy-going scene. That would give us something strong to post on social media. Even if that doesn\'t happen, we can use the cocktail videos for social media.', '&emsp;A song from the good old days, when the City of Miami was yet to be anything other than good to me. \"Down By Biscayne\" was written during hurricane Irma, when good old Dr. Julio Frenk shut down campus for almost a month, and right after school began. Instead of partying and seeing my friends, I was stuck in a tiny New York studio apartment with my sister and her cat. No shade to my sister, I just missed the University.', '../gameplan-assets/lal/dbb-merch.png');const dbbElement = document.getElementById('dbb');dbbElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		dbbModal.openModal();});const lalModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/lal/lal-modular-bg.jpg', 'Love of a Lifetime', 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1724444625%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-YwX0alRntUJ', 'Lyric Video', '&emsp;As Queen as possible. With a black background, and animated. This is one of my songs that\'s heavily inspired by Freddie and his band. The marketing should correspond to this, with 70s and 80s visuals, and bombastic stylized words, coming up not only for the lead vocals, but for the choir in the background.', '&emsp;Flower deliveries! Let\'s make use of my Ecuadorian connections in the flower world. We export a ton of those. Now, the flowers aren\'t gonna last, but what would? Oh yeah, a beautiful SD plant pot to go with it. My mom works in interior decoration, so I\'m sure she\'d be happy to hook us up with a good deal.', '&emsp;By this point we should have romantic footage from our other projects. Whether shot on purpose or bloopers. Whether its our characters, or our crew. Whether it\'s our cinematic project, or our live shows. We\'ll make a compilation of fun times, and sync it with the song. With good editing, this will make for excellent vibe-y social media clips, but would also make for an excellent music video depending on how it comes out. Yes, the album is titled \"Love of a Lifetime (and other failed relationships)\", but for this release, we leave aside the parenthesis, and let ourselves dream.', '', '../gameplan-assets/lal/lal-merch.png');const lalElement = document.getElementById('lal');lalElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		lalModal.openModal();});		</script>
