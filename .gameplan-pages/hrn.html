				<p>&emsp;The sound of letting yourself hope. The Happiness That Religion Needs (also the meaning of the name 'Saadin') is a rejection of cynicism, and a push to the romantics of the world to keep believing, regardless of the judgement of cynics. This release is the most ambitious in marketing and filming, which is why it is left for 2028. It concretely establishes the world of Emmamile rather than just having hints about it as background easter eggs, but it will require a sizeable budget. I don't mean Hollywood sized, but I do mean bigger than what I usually get.</p>

Set in the end days of the planet, we follow the story of Ivo, an Emmamilian woman who must quickly escape a war zone with her infant nephew. Her journey is a non-stop battle against hopelessness, which she cannot afford to lose.', '&emsp;Emmamilian inscription rings with symbols. Two different phrases from which fans can choose. \"Love Shall Endure\" (featured in the film), and \"Seek Hope\".', '&emsp;We can tease the short film by showing little history shorts from Emmamile, all starting with \"THE FOLLOWING BROADCAST HAS BEEN TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH FROM ITS ORIGINAL LANGUAGE.\" The final short we post has to transition into the short film.', '', '../gameplan-assets/hrn/twt-merch.png');const centerpieceElement = document.getElementById("centerpiece");centerpieceElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		twtModal.openModal();});const tmrModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/hrn/tmr-modular-bg.jpg', 'Tomorrow', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQ-FyMsAr8Q', 'Music Video Feature', '&emsp;A music video animated by Saadin Dassum himself, depicting a 90s Nintendo-inspired dream of a windy future in the mountains. This music video could be featured before a movie in the summertime, kind of how Disney puts their shorts before their actual movie. This little music video would be a perfect tone-setter for a love story or rom-com.', '&emsp;Couple crew necks with Key and Stevie, along with the SD logo.', '&emsp;We can upload behind the scenes footage of the making of the video, which I have a TON of from 2021 (the year I started animating).', '', '../gameplan-assets/hrn/tmr-merch.png');const tmrElement = document.getElementById('tmr');tmrElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		tmrModal.openModal();});const lnhModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/hrn/lnh-modular-bg.jpg', 'Lionheart', 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1712231124%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-imKKSoPjBPA', 'Videos explaining the story', '&emsp;I consider this to be one of the most sentimental songs I\'ve written. I believe it\'s a strong selling point, which fits the theme of the release. We can ask my friends Saidy Burch or Karla Capri to make an animated video about the story.', '&emsp;In order to not capitalize on a good man\'s tragedy, this release gets Tomorrow sweaters as merch. After all, Key and Stevie\'s music video was also greatly inspired by two summers I spent in Switzerland.', '&emsp;Our social media campaign should rely on the story videos.', '&emsp;My father once told me the story of an Ecuadorian pediatric surgeon named Leon. He was great enough at his craft that he was granted a visa to work in Switzerland, where he helped many children. In his 40s, after having moved back to Ecuador, Leon fell victim to the very same disease he worked so hard to treat. He flew back to Switzerland, where his old colleagues unsuccessfully attempted to treat him, and he passed away.<br>&emsp;When I heard the story of Leon, he struck me as the kind of guy who would appreciate the world even more when he was told his days were numbered, a man grateful for his life, but struggling to let go of it. A man who just wanted to tell his friends and family how much he loved them. Lionheart is inspired by the end days of Leon.', '../gameplan-assets/hrn/lnh-merch.png');const lnhElement = document.getElementById('lnh');lnhElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		lnhModal.openModal();});		</script>
