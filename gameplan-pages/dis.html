All that is required is a re-edit of the raw files, which I have. Low budget, high quality.', '&emsp;It is my dream (and I\'d argue a lot of other people\'s) to have a longsleeve shirt or pullover with the dancing astronauts as the breast emblem. I\'m taking inspiration here from the old <a href=\'https://www.crashmania.net/en/collectibles/clothing/1996-2008/\'>Crash Bandicoot pullovers from the 90s</a> (they\'re the very first row if you click on the link). They look so freaking sleek, I\'m sorry, I just can\'t say it any other way! The dancing astronauts would look awesome on those pullovers, as well as on shirts, sweaters, and of course, stickers.<br>&emsp;There are two requirements for this merch plan. First is to get Grant DeLaVasselais\'s permission. He made the original artwork for me for free, and it wouldn\'t be fair for him not to have a cut. And second is actually manufacturing all this merch. We want quality, we want something that will last and make fans as well as the environment happy. Beautiful designs, and no fast fashion fuckery.', '&emsp;Throug the past few years, my friend Brandon Hadeed and I have been creating a world around the video of Glasgow Lady and a few other music videos, along with an alien language, and an explanation of where these human-like creatures came from, and a whole language that they use! In social media, we can post 15-20 second cinematic bits of the story without revealing everything. This would also keep the intrigue up, and people could guess what is going on. There\'s a ton of fun to be had in the mystery.<br>&emsp;Obviously, the requirement here is to actually film those shorts and make sound for them.', '', '../gameplan-assets/dis/gls-merch.png');const centerpieceElement = document.getElementById("centerpiece");centerpieceElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		glsModal.openModal();});const ansModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/dis/ans-modular-bg.jpg', 'Animal Song (Savage Instinct)', 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1727224329%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-s5DUcKL7ghd', 'The Victims of Animal Song', '&emsp;When the original Animal Song was released, I had an excellent idea, which was to promote the song with porn stars. I\'d ask trending pornography stars to endorse the song as the sexiest song in the history of songs. This culminated in a video that parodied the typical porn scenario, where a guy is delivering pizza to a house and paid with sex. Unfortunately, the pizza guy in my video was having trouble paying his mortgage, and was upset to keep getting paid with sex. This all happened because of some curse that fell upon the characters of the video after they listened to Animal Song.<br>&emsp;The original idea was to have real life pornstars feature in the video to promote the song. My understanding is that porn stars are way cheaper than a celebrity. Unfortunately, they were still a little out of my personal budget, and many of them weren\'t willing to work with me as an independent.<br>&emsp;More unfortunately, I think some jackass TikToker stole my idea in 2021, and had a better budget and more time. That being said, the original is always better, and there\'s more stories and skits left to tell with these characters. Plus, we can go back to the original idea of having real porn stars play the characters. They\'re way more likely to say yes if I\'m backed by a label or group. I have the contacts, I just don\'t have the credibility.', '&emsp;I say we base our merch off the video. Sure we can have stickers and the typical stuff and yada yada, but we have an opportunity here to be stupid, and to be funny. Let\'s hire beautiful sorority girls to hand out Animal Song condoms and lube all over UM and Miami! Let\'s make SD lingerine! Thongs that say \'all I think about\' on the butt area! Sex toys might be a little too far for me, but hell, I can be convinced if you ask me to. Maybe some handcuffs. The song somehow hates hookup culture, and partakes in it at the same time, and its merch can do the exact same thing.', '&emsp;I\'d also love to make an animalistic coreography music video for the song so we can release on YouTube. It should have a bloody ending during that last chorus a la <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UbQgXeY_zi4?si=XIMO0SU50jUiwBJ5&t=122\">Lone Digger</a>, except in this video it should be the dancers getting a little too excited with each other and clawing and biting at each other, with close-ups of blood gushing out.  I know a few people in Miami who can help out with that.<br>&emsp;That being said, I still want to focus on the porn aspect of the song. Lena Paul is a history major, and it would be freaking hilarious to hire her to give an unsexy one hour lecture on the most bland and boring history subject she could tell us about. We can also post small clips from the \"victims of animal song\" video on the weeks prior and after the release.', '&emsp;The sex part of sex, drugs and rock and roll. Animal Song is split on both hating and partaking in hookup culture, as the narrator is obviously enjoying what he\'s doing, but there\'s a sense of resentment towards himself and his partner. This song is danceable, sexy, and weird. The perfect Saadin Dassum combo.', '../gameplan-assets/dis/ans-merch.png');const ansElement = document.getElementById('ans');ansElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		ansModal.openModal();});const domModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/dis/dom-modular-bg.jpg', 'Dancing on the Moon', 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1682988504%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-KtFSUBSOiHD', 'Lyric video', '&emsp;The instruments in this song make it perfect for an animated lyric video. Nothing too crazy. I can ask my friend Fernanda Lamuño to help out, she\'s done work with me before and she\'s phenomenal! And of course, I\'ll still be storyboarding and making sure it keeps ME hooked to the end.', '&emsp;Back in 2020 I made a few fleeces with the alien language. But since the pandemic era hit, I didn\'t get a ton of live shows to sell them at. Now is the time to pull them out!', '&emsp;On Instagram stories we can post videos of characters from movies having fun to the track. We\'ll also be posting behind the scenes of the creation of videos for Glasgow Lady, Animal Song, and Birds. All videos posted have to be of people having a good time. I have an excellent video where Jackie who plays the girl in Glasgow Lady tackles me into a pool while everyone else laughs their butts off. It\'s that kind of stuff that we want to post.', 'Like Saadin had a baby with LCD Soundsystem (yes, all of them). This dance track manages to hang onto its rock and roll roots despite heading more towards synthwave, and pours pure ear candy into a the track. It\'s a story of dropping everything you need to do just to have fun in your love for a bit.', '../gameplan-assets/dis/dom-merch.png');const domElement = document.getElementById('dom');domElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		domModal.openModal();});const brdModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/dis/brd-modular-bg.jpg', 'Birds', 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1683754749%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-EHLYoyQuDRb', 'Music Video', '&emsp;Flashback to October 2021 when I got onto the Velocicoaster at Islands of Adventure, and as it charged up for the ride, I felt intense anxiety. I had been working on this song, and right as the \'coaster launched, its instrumental came into my head, and I felt pure euphoria, like I was flying!<br>&emsp;Instead of me, we bring on Jason Mantzoukas, the perfect man to show off beautiful sharp insanity as he rides through pink cotton candy clouds on a journey of self-discovery. The correct approach for this is to make it similar to John Mayer\'s New Light, which means all we need is a green screen, a rollercoaster seat (which maybe we can find at a fair), and a camera.', '&emsp;Stickers of adorable stinger-less bees with the SD logo. Ultra-cheesy post-cards that say \"You\'re the kind of girl I\'d give up the stinger for. And I don\'t mean the car.\" And in an ideal, crazy world, Birds brand honey, with a subtitle claiming \"Stinger-less\" and an SD logo below it.', '&emsp;I describe Birds as the baby of Radio Gaga, Plastic Love, and the theme song from Futurama. It just so happens that Radio Gaga was used on the most iconic trailer which has managed to stick in my mind since 2013: The Michael trailer for Grand Theft Auto V. So indulge me on this one, because it\'s gonna kick ass. We model a trailer using footage from videos including but not limited to the Dream In Stereo release, and we make it feel as GTA as possible. Finally, we sync Birds to it and post clips on social media. This idea can also happen later down the line, as it\'s a cross-release promotion tool.<br>&emsp;Once we\'ve got Jason Mantzoukas, we HAVE to keep him around for a few more short clips which we could post on social media. One of us trying to spell each other\'s names and failing. One of us trying to pronounce each other\'s names and failing. And one thirty second to a minute long video of us arguing about relationship advice, where I advocate for the calm and collected option, and he DOES NOT.', '<strong>Simping</strong>. That\'s it. It\'s about going way too far for the love of a girl. It\'s a bad idea, and I\'ve done it before. Birds came from asking how far I could take that.', '../gameplan-assets/dis/brd-merch.png');const brdElement = document.getElementById('brd');brdElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		brdModal.openModal();});		</script>	</body></html>
