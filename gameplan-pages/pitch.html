			<h2>What you get if you sign me</h2>
			<div class="max-width">
				<p>&emsp;Sure, there's a lot of quirky dudes out there who make music, but I've got a certain pizazz that others don't. Here's what really sets me apart:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>The first Spanglish rocker,</strong> who speaks both tongues natively and can connect deeply with audiences in two continents. I was raised and deeply influenced by both American and Latin American cultures. I am in touch with both, and will remain so with the rest of my life.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Plans for the next three to five years.</strong> As you may see in the rest of the gameplan site, there are already plans pre-made and ready to go for releases, social media and merchandise. All they need is a push. On top of this, add the story of Emmamile, a sci-fi dramedy connecting my music videos which has been in the works since 2019. The story even comes with its own alien language, perfect for making cool merch.</li><br>
					<li><strong>The backing of a nation.</strong> We have local celebrities. And if you're from here, you might be able to name a few. But do you know of any Ecuadorian names that are big in the international market? We're very much ignored. We're the Luigi to Peru's Mario. It will drive Ecuadorians <em>nuts</em> to see one of their own on the world stage. It always does, even when we're doing minor things like directing an indie movie in English. My music would have the support of the whole country, especially after the release of Rock in Spanglish.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Authenticity.</strong> While yes, I'd like to make a nice, comfy living, I'm here to put out art from the soul. From my music, to my image, to my marketing. I want none of that cookie-cutter copy-paste bullshit. I'm dedicated to what I make. I'm not here to follow a forgettable trend. I'm here to make lasting impact.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Me.</strong> Making the art I'm making right now but on steroids. I made this site while working on all the demos, and two apps. Imagine what I could pull off when I'm devoted to my artistry.</li><br>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h2>What's the catch?</h2>
			<div class="max-width">
				<p>&emsp;Like we programmers like to say, there's no such thing as a free lunch. There's always a catch. And that's why I'd like for you to... invest in a timeshare!<br><br>
					&emsp;Just kidding, here's the real catch. We're partners in this. 50/50. <em>"But why?"</em>, I hear you ask. Well, I'll be involved in everything, from the art, to the webiste, to the creative desicions. To touring, to practicing, to PR events. My work goes beyond that of writing and producing. While I'm hoping to get resources from the partnership to help to execute my ideas, I'll be calling many of the shots for the art to remain authentic, and I'll be providing business and manufacturing connections in Ecuador, the US, and elsewhere.<br><br>
					&emsp;You're going to work with someone who can put out a memorable, witty, and charismatic image, while remaining an effective and reliable business partner in the office. I love to clown around on the surface, but I'm a professional. I deliver on my word (and on my signature, wink wink). When it comes down to brass tacks, I'm willing to sit down, analyze, and take care of a problem.</p><br><br>
					&emsp;Aside from that, I ask that we work in an environmentally friendly way, and I also ask is that those who helped me with content that's already created get compensated fairly. For example Grant De La Vasselais with various cover arts, and Brandon Hadeed with the Emmamilian language. That's it!
