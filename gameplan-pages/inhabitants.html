But instead you're here asking me about that one time I wore a chilli pepper thong on stage."</blockquote>
				<p>&emsp;A jazz professor at Miami University. As serious about his craft as can be. Skilled... Disciplined... His life was going perfectly as planned, until Saadin Dassum walked his into class, recognized him, and blew his cover. As it turns out, Dr. Brussel was a member of 80s hair metal band "Wawayou" - famous for performing outrageous live shows with stunts like explosions, live animals, and drugs on stage.<br>
                &emsp;The class gasped, one of the students took a picture, someone made a meme, social media spread it... Because of this, it's no mystery how he feels about Mr. Dassum.<br>&emsp;These days, Ryan is working hard to once again shake off his wildboy image in order to gain the respect of his jazz peers. Sadly, this is being made infinitely more difficult by old band members who want to see their friends after discovering where he's been for the last twenty years.<br></p>

				<p>&emsp;An inhabitant of Emmamile. More importantly, a member of the second-to-last generation of the planet. Ivo's jaded, but who can blame her? Through her life she watched just a handful of people on her planet manipulate and tear apart everyone else. How she ended up on Earth, I'm not sure yet. She keeps real quiet about it. I have to imagine it wasn't pretty. Second-to-last, remember?<br></p>

				<p>&emsp;Aww, June and Saadin. A classic. These folks re-define eternal love. Unfortunately for them they also seem to re-define on-again-off-again. This pair of teen-drama-worthy lovebirds seem to pop up during important moments in history, but are frequently at odds with each other. And yes, of course they cede to each other whenever they can. that's what love is after all, isn't it? I've seen them in the Wild West, the Golden Age of Hollywood, the future... God knows how they get there, but watever era they're in, these knuckleheads can't seem to find a way to make it work.<br></p>

			<h2>Danny Strana</h2>

			<div class='character-description'>
                <blockquote class="blue">Well yeah, I'm grateful for my time in Wawayou. I remember those days fondly, and I owe everything I have to them.</blockquote>
				<p>&emsp;The legend goes that in the fine summer of '83, Danny Strana spent his his late nights practicing some devious key riffs at Melvo Servi's house. Upon his 3AM arrivals, his Italian-American dad would always angirly yell the same thing... "Where were you?" Hence, the notorious band got its name.<br>
					This 80s hair-metal keyboardist was last spotted in Miami, attempting to re-kindle an old kinship with a hesitant friend.

                <blockquote class="blue">Oh, hell yeah. those were the days. I'd go back in a snap, but I'm glad to be where I'm at!</blockquote>
				<p>&emsp;Bum, da, da bum. Growing up in the 70s, music was the LAST THING little Melvin's parents wanted him to do. But the more they pushed, the more he seemed to push back. At some point between Melvo's voice cracking and him losing his virginity, his parents realized he had a ton of unused energy, so they caved in and gifted the boy a drumset.<br>
					Servi kicked ass all throughout the 80s, spawning the most successful solo career from any member of the band, and even winning awards in other genres. Servi is currently in Miami, seeking out his lost friend Ryan Brussel.
