			<h2>Ryan Brussel</h2>
			<div class='character-description'>
                <blockquote class="blue"><em>"It was three years, okay? just three years. Just for once you could be asking me about my new song. It's gorgeous. It could become a 21st century Jazz standard! But instead you're here asking me about that one time I wore a chilli pepper thong on stage."</em></blockquote>
				<p>&emsp;A jazz professor at Miami University. As serious about his craft as can be. Skilled... Disciplined... His life was going perfectly as planned, until Saadin Dassum walked his into class, recognized him, and blew his cover. As it turns out, Mr. Brussel is an ex-member of 80s hair metal band <em>"Wawayou"</em> - famous for performing outrageous live shows with stunts like explosions, live animals, and drugs on stage.<br>
                &emsp;Social media spread the word about Brussel and his past, sealing his feelings towards Mr. Dassum. These days, Ryan is working hard to once again shake off his wildboy image in order to gain the respect of his jazz peers. Sadly, this is being made infinitely more difficult by old band members who want to see their friends after discovering where he's been for the last twenty years.<br></p>
                <blockquote class="saadin-on cream-purple"><em>"You know he taught me how to actually hold a pick? I freaking LOVE that guy! I'm not sure he loves me back, though..."</em></blockquote>

			<h2>Ivo</h2>
			<div class='character-description'>
                <blockquote class="blue"><em>"So what? No matter what we do, the world's screwing us over. Nothing matters anymore."</em></blockquote>
				<p>&emsp;An inhabitant of Emmamile. More importantly, a member of the second-to-last generation of the planet. Ivo's jaded, but who can blame her? Through her life she watched just a handful of people on her planet manipulate and tear apart everyone else. How she ended up on Earth, I'm not sure yet. She keeps real quiet about it. I have to imagine it wasn't pretty. Second-to-last, remember?<br></p>

			<h2>The Time Travelling Lovers</h2>
			<div class='character-description'>
                <blockquote class="blue"><em>I got your flowers. And I loved them, I really did! Unfortunately, sweetie, I'm still going to have to ask you to put your hands up.</em></blockquote>
				<p>&emsp;These folks re-define eternal love. Unfortunately for them they also seem to re-define on-again-off-again. This pair of teen-drama-worthy lovebirds seem to pop up during important moments in history, but are frequently at odds with each other. And yes, of course they cede to each other whenever they can. that's what love is after all, isn't it? I've seen them in the Wild West, the Golden Age of Hollywood, the future... God knows how they get there, but watever era they're in, these knuckleheads can't seem to find a way to make it work.<br></p>
