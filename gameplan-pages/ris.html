Our protagonist gets closer and closer to his goal, but always seems to fail, kind of like in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mYBSayCsH0\">this good old music video</a>.<br>&emsp;The idea is to draw from fun 90s music videos like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GELqjEQekNo\">Taqui Taqui</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IVvILl1QiE\">El Tiburón</a>. These are heavy on choreography, and on people having fun. The backstory of the song is funny enough to be developed into a comedy. This short film will provide everything, from social media clips to a full-on music video. This 10 minute romcom can also be submitted to film festivals for cheap.', '&emsp;The title of the song comes from the Spanish way of saying \"to the power of x\". In Spanish, you would say \"elevated to x\". We absolutely have to go as Miami as we can on this merch, with neon sunset colors, and references to meeting the girl in the dream. We also wanna lean into Spanglish factor here. Stickers in a thought bubble that say \"girl of my sueños\". Soccer-like jerseys with <3^6 on the back.', '&emsp;Like with the merch, we should be leaning into the Spanglish. We\'ll want to be posting and sponsoring clips of the 10 minute music video, and posting these videos as if they were trailers for the romcom itself rather than just the song.', '&emsp;Right before I left Ecuador for college, I had a dream about seeing this girl on the beach. And she was <em>the one</em>. She was gorgeous. And I remembered how she looked like, which is not usual for a dream.<br>&emsp;Flash forward just one or two months later to my arrival at the University of Miami, and there she is in full glory in the dorm elevator. Now, how the hell do I go about this? If I tell her anything, I\'m going to sound weird and insane!<br>And that\'s why I wrote this crazy little song in Spanish!', '../gameplan-assets/ris/crz-merch.png');const centerpieceElement = document.getElementById("centerpiece");centerpieceElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		crzModal.openModal();});const mdqModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/ris/mdq-modular-bg.jpg', 'Más de lo que Debo', 'src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1697373474%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-GXqjSXG9fVd', 'Lyric Video', '&emsp;I put effort into all my song\'s lyrics, but I think these are especially tight. This, along with the peppy nature of the song makes it a perfect match for a lyric video, which can use clips from the <3^6 music video.', '&emsp;Leather journals. For the romantic Saadin Dassum fans. The song talks about having more memories with the girl who it\'s for. On the bottom right of the cover, they can have an SD logo engraving, and on the inside of the cover, they can say \"Para más de nuestros recuerdos\" in a nice cursive font. The journal can also be included as a notable prop in the ten minute rom-com for stronger marketing. We won\'t just make it an item, we\'ll make in <em>an item</em>.', '&emsp;Once again, the ten minute rom-com is our best friend here, giving us the ability to sync the song to short clips of it, especially ones that might feature the journal.', '&emsp;Inspired in party by the happiness of the 60s and 70s glory days of ELO, Dassum expresses his regret in having been a cynic.', '../gameplan-assets/ris/mdq-merch.png');const mdqElement = document.getElementById('mdq');mdqElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		mdqModal.openModal();});const jcgModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/ris/jcg-modular-bg.jpg', 'Jacoba Guitarras', 'src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1683785991%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-HLmvBwgW6Cz', 'How to Be a Latin Lover', '&emsp;Not to be confused with the 2017 Eugenio Derbez comedy. These shorts are inspired by these <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiWUj9jeV94&list=PL4XYugONL7lbohFXtRawhHjtCoDw9c3pb\">Better Call Saul promotional shorts</a>. In the video, we\'ll pose me as a super-seducer with a hispanic accent (I can pull a hell of one off, and I\'ve got a pass because I\'m from Ecuador). These videos will detail how to be a latin super seducer, but in reality they\'ll be making fun of the archetype, and showing womanizers as damaged people.<br>&emsp;These shorts will be montages wherer the seducer will appear at luxurious places, such as the beach and a spa, always accompanied by beautiful women. What the character slowly reveals is that he had his heart broken by June (a recurring character across my releases), and only maintains his habits in order to distract himself from thinking of her. The videos will promote Rock in Spanglish as the true album of the Latin lover.', '&emsp;Bath robes, soy-free candles, bath bombs and insence for the brokenhearted Latin lovers who want to feel more in touch with Saadin Dassum\'s most relaxing song.', '&emsp;We\'ll be relying on the How to Be a Latin Lover shorts for social media clips. That being said, if the song is successful, it will warrant a music video which leans into the lyrics of the song, where the narrator is very obviously writing a cheesy love song despite not admitting it directly. Like the song, the video should become more and more over-the-top as it goes on.', '', '../gameplan-assets/ris/jcg-merch.png');const jcgElement = document.getElementById('jcg');jcgElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		jcgModal.openModal();});const tqaModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/ris/tqa-modular-bg.jpg', 'Te Quiero Amar', 'src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1726822749%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-rku0lJclkYa', 'Ten Minute Rom-com', '&emsp; The same ten minute rom-com from <3^6 can be a shared marketing centerpiece with \"Te Quiero Amar\". The song is excellent trailer music, so associating the entire project with the sound of \"I Want You Back\" would be an outstanding move to direct people to the entire release.', '&emsp;We\'re a bit limited on merch for covers, but fear not, for this is the perfect place for a cool lil\' sticker pack. 60s graphics, SD logos, music symbols coming out of pianos. All stickers at their grooviest to celebrate this 60s hit in its new Rock en Español form. What a feel good song, man.', '&emsp; On socials, we\'re still relying on clips from the ten minute rom-com. Just keep in mind we need a sync license for the song!', '&emsp;What Luis Miguel did for \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOnxY24Y5vA\">Blame It On the Boogie</a>\", Saadin Dassum is doing for \"I Want You Back\".The greatest cover of the song so far, bringing the classic to a new audience in a new language with a bombastic rock-jazz-latin fusion piano finale.
