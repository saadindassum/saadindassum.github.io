				<p>&emsp;<strong>The Moon. The moon has always been there.</strong> Through your good times, and through your bad times. But what has it changed? It just keeps on watching you try over and over again. And that's how it will be forever.</p>
				<p>&emsp;The Mercy of the Moon is an exploration of nihilism and nostalgia through the scope of absurdism. 
				"Made for Dancing" sets the stage for how the narrator got to where he is, and "Mornings" describes 
				cycles that the narrator finds difficult to break. Both songs feel light despite their lyrics 
				thanks to their	peppy, upbeat instrumentals, which is why they set the stage perfectly for "The
				Mercy of the Moon", which does not hold back in its pure, mad hopelessness.</p>

The plan is for this music video to tour around various film festivals. Secondary promotion projects include exploitation in media and television shows through sync deals, which should spread its popularity.';
			var mrcMerchPlans = '&emsp;The strongest candidate for Mercy merch is the music video poster, with a cassette tape containing the Mercy painting, and some credits stylized to look like computer code.';
			var mrcMerchImg = '../gameplan-assets/mrc/mrc-merch.png';
			var mrcSocialMedia = '&emsp;The plan is to post video clips (used and unused in the music video) of the cassette tape memories on social media. The video and song could be sold as an analog horror short. Analog horror is an internet sub-culture, and using hashtags related to it could help us gain a following. While the video wouldn\'t be classified as horror, let\'s keep in mind that Kubric\'s "The Shining" was advertised as a family movie in its trailers, and the raunchy Deadpool was marketed as a romcom. Both movies enjoyed great success.<br><br>&emsp;We can start posting these teaser videos up to two months before the release date, after which we should have one more week to keep the ball rolling, and two weeks to market the other songs without losing momentum.<br><br>&emsp;To pull this campaign off, all we need to do is select some good clips, run the videos through my VCR preset in Premiere, and maybe throw the instrumental of the song into DAW Cassette, which will help me make the master sound like it has tape distortionz.';

Two figures - a classy, rich man and a punk rocker - will both rival each other bully him to try to pull them towards their life styles, all while the protagonist tries to make them get along.<br><br>&emsp;The plot of the video will loosely follow that of the song, with everything filmed on a paper-based old-Hollywood-like set. The plan is to cast Mary Mouser as June a woman who leaves Saadin, and to have her character appear in other videos (musical and promotional) such as Birds, and the \'How To Be A Latin Lover\' shorts for Rock in Spanglish.';

			var mfdSynopsis = '&emsp;<strong>When it rains, it pours.</strong> After a rough year in his life, Dassum took to writing this peppy, Bowie-esque anthem of hopelessness. Within a single week, his girlfriend had broken up with him and two family members passed away, one in a gruesome manner and right before Dassum\'s eyes. All the while, Dassum was working himself beyond exhaustion working as a programmer at a bank, and simultaneously developing two apps and keeping up his musical carreer.';
