				<p>&emsp;<strong>The Moon. The moon has always been there.</strong> Through your good times, and through your bad times. But what has it changed? It just keeps on watching you try over and over again. And that's how it will be forever.<br>&emsp;The Mercy of the Moon is an exploration of nihilism and nostalgia through the scope of absurdism. "Made for Dancing" sets the stage for how the narrator got to where he is, and "Mornings" describes cycles that the narrator finds difficult to break. Both songs feel light despite their lyrics thanks to their peppy, upbeat instrumentals, which is why they set the stage perfectly for "The Mercy of the Moon", which does not hold back in its pure, mad hopelessness.</p>

The plan is for this music video to tour around various film festivals. Secondary promotion projects include exploitation in media and television shows through sync deals, which will spread its popularity.', '&emsp;The strongest candidate for Mercy merch is the music video poster, with a cassette tape containing the Mercy painting, and some credits stylized to look like computer code.<br>&emsp;The production fo these posters can be cheaply handled in Ecuador through Saadin\'s contacts.', '&emsp;\"He was eaten by the fog...\" The plan is to post video clips (used and unused in the music video) of the cassette tape memories on social media. We could also post clips of people dressed up in the same color scheme as the stuffed animals as in the music video, seemingly trying to escape \"the fog\". The video and song could be sold as an analog horror short. Analog horror is an internet sub-culture, and using hashtags related to it could help us gain a following. While the video wouldn\'t be classified as horror, let\'s keep in mind that Kubric\'s \"The Shining\" was advertised as a family movie in its trailers, and the raunchy Deadpool was marketed as a romcom. Both movies enjoyed great success.<br><br>&emsp;We can start posting these teaser videos up to two months before the release date, after which we should have one more week to keep the ball rolling, and two weeks to market the other songs without losing momentum.<br><br>&emsp;To pull this campaign off, all we need to do is select some good clips, run the videos through my VCR preset in Premiere, and maybe throw the instrumental of the song into DAW Cassette, which will help me make the master sound like it has tape distortion.', '', '../gameplan-assets/mrc/mrc-merch.png');const centerpieceElement = document.getElementById("centerpiece");centerpieceElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		mrcModal.openModal();});const mfdModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/mrc/mfd-modular-bg.jpg', 'Made For Dancing', 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1668072747%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-9NuQZcGsvEG', 'Music Video', '&emsp;The music video will focus on a protagonist with a 9 to 5 who watches everyone other than himself achieve their dreams while he\'s chained to a desk. Two figures - a pompus, rich snob and a punk rocker - will both compete with each other, and bully the protagonist in an attempt to try to pull them towards their life styles, all while the protagonist tries to get along with both of them.<br><br>&emsp;The plot of the video will somwhat follow that of the song, with everything filmed on a paper-based old-Hollywood style set. The plan is to cast Mary Mouser as June a woman who leaves Saadin, and to have her character appear in other videos (musical and promotional) such as Birds, and the \'How To Be A Latin Lover\' shorts for Rock in Spanglish.', '&emsp;Shirts, crew neck sweaters, and stickers will be sold with heart shapes labeled \'Made for dancing\' and/or \'This heart was made for dancing\' along with the SD logo.<br><br>&emsp;The font used in the mockup is called \'Fourside\'. The idea is also to design a more fun heart than the one speedily done in the mockup.', '&emsp;Alright, we NEED to upload dance tutorials. And not just any dance tutorials. We want old dance moves that fit with rock. I\'m talking 50s to 80s. We can post these along with little trailers for the music video<br><br>', '&emsp;<strong>When it rains, it pours.</strong> After a rough year in his life, Dassum took to writing this peppy, Bowie-esque anthem of hopelessness. Within a single week, his girlfriend had broken up with him and two family members passed away, one in a gruesome manner and right before Dassum\'s eyes. All the while, Dassum was working himself beyond exhaustion working as a programmer at a bank, and simultaneously developing two apps and keeping up his musical carreer.', '../gameplan-assets/mrc/mfd-merch.png');const mfdElement = document.getElementById('mfd');mfdElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		mfdModal.openModal();});const mrnModal = new ProjectModal('../gameplan-assets/mrc/mrn-modular-bg.jpg', 'Mornings', 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1657581540%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-MhIbUaqgtuK', 'Alarm Tone', '&emsp;A chiptune-ish instrumental version of the song will be created and added as a ringtone, specifically marketed to iOS users through a short video mentioning how the iOS ringtone sounds like a wartime alarm.', '&emsp;The go-to merch item for this song is sleek-looking mugs that say \"Mornings are my hell\". These mugs can be manufactured in Ecuador through Saadin\'s contacts.', '&emsp;The plan is to upload a series of three to five videos parodying influencers who do morning routines for success. In these videos, Saadin will be giving tips on morning routines, only for everything to disastrously fall apart. A short example is a video where Saadin makes tea in the morning. He explains everything calmly at first, but things quickly devolve. Maybe Saadin burns himself, and the mug falls off the counter and breaks, and Saadin just ends up cussing everything to hell. Certainly a fun idea to poke fun at those who might be following the \"algorithm\", and marketable as a shitpost on Reddit and Instagram (shoot me a dm and ask me what those are if you\'re not sure).', '', '../gameplan-assets/mrc/mrn-merch.png');const mrnElement = document.getElementById('mrn');mrnElement.addEventListener("click", e => {		mrnModal.openModal();});		</script>
